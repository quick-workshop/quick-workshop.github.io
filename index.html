    <h2>Scope</h2>
    <p>
        Urgent Analytics refers to a class of time-critical scientific applications that that leverage distributed data sources to provide real-time insights and decision-making capabilities. 
        Examples of urgent applications span various domains including, but not limited to, emergency response systems, weather forecasting, fire science and disease outbreak detection.
        The overall goal of Urgent Computing is to predict the outcome of such scenarios early enough to mitigate their negative consequences.
</p>
	<p>
		The 3rd International Workshop on Urgent Analytics for the Computing Continuum (QUICK'25) seeks scientific contributions that leverage on-demand computational resources across IoT, Edge, Cloud and HPC, also known as the Computing Continuum, 
        to support critical analytics applications. 
    </p>
<h2>Important Dates</h2>
	<p>
		Paper Submission: Feb 24, 2025 AoE <br>
        Author Notification: March 4, 2025 <br>
        Camera ready papers: TBD <br>
	 	Workshop: May 19, 2025
  </p>
	<h2>Contributions</h2>
    <!-- <p>
        Integrating urgent analytics with geo-distributed resources is hindered by a lack of abstractions and software stacks that can support data-driven reactive behaviors, i.e., for determining what, where, and when data is collected and processed across the edge-to-cloud/HPC computing continuum. Managing data-driven applications requires programming models and resource management for adaptive strategies, able to effectively react to unexpected events and trigger appropriate actions. Such contributions have the potential to address today's global grand challenges in science, engineering, and society. 
    </p> -->
	
<p>
		We are looking for original high-quality research on urgent applications across the continuum where real-timeliness, reliability and scalability are the main factors to pursue. Topics in the following areas are of particular interest, plus others that are not explicitly listed but are closely related: 
</p>
<ul>
			<li>- Algorithms, models and systems considerations in designing urgent applications across the Computing Continuum</li>
			<li>- Programming support for user expectations and constraints in terms of response time, solution quality, data resolution, cost, energy, etc.</li>
			<li>- Run-time techniques to provide flexible execution models for computation and communication.</li>
			<li>- Resource management frameworks and interfaces supporting scheduling, resource allocations and application execution for the computing continuum.</li>
			<li>- Use of AI and ML techniques to steer urgency in systems and applications.</li>
			<li>- Experiences and use cases applying urgent science and emergency to computing continuum infrastructures.</li>
			<li>- Edge Intelligence models, Autonomic Computing and Distributed Machine Learning</li>
			<li>- Policy driven service and resource life-cycle management</li>
			<li>- Feedback, Control and Observability for the Continuum</li>
			<li>- Data analysis techniques and network solutions for emergency prediction and disaster management</li>
			<li>- Opportunistic and ad-hoc communication systems</li>
</ul>
